Use Usenti

Instructions:
Open your tile in usenti, make sure the palette is ordered from brightest to darkest like in the game, and that you are using the first color for the background
Select "Image", then "Export"
When it asks you for a name be sure to add .bin, otherwise you'll get a text file (the .img will add itself so just add the .bin)
For the exporting options you want only the GFX box selected, the mode set to bitmap (GBA) and the depth to 2bpp
