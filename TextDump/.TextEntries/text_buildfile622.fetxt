Items have a limited number of[NL]

uses. Each time you use an item[.][NL]

its durability goes down. The[.][NL]

number next to an item indicates[NL]

how many times it can be used.[NL]

When that number reaches 0, the[.][NL]

item breaks and disappears.[.][NL]

Be careful not to let items drop[NL]

to 0 in the heat of battle.[.][X]
