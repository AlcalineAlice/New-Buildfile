Use Usenti

Instructions:
Open image in usenti
Select "Image", then "Export"
When it asks you for a name be sure to add .bin, otherwise you'll get a text file (the .img will add itself so just add the .bin)
For the exporting options you want only the GFX box selected, the mode set to tile and the depth to 4bpp 
then rename it as .4bpp file extension
